                    <p>
                        I got started in design mostly out of curiosity. I had a
                        couple hobbies that I enjoyed making websites for and I
                        was learning a lot about digital interfaces and HCI in
                        order to improve my sites. As my knowledge in that field
                        grew, I became more invested in learning as much as I
                        could about design, mostly from a web design
                        perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my last semester of college, studying Fine Arts:
                        Design, I secured a job as a web designer for an agency
                        that has since been absorbed. We had a project come in
                        to build a learning management system and that’s when I
                        discovered UI design and really started putting names to
                        the concepts that make up UX design. I found my stride
                        here working on this application and the partner company
                        took notice and I was asked to join as the lead designer
                        for a race event management software. I was working
                        across a lot of the product life cycle at this stage,
                        even teaching myself to code, becoming responsible for
                        all discovery, documentation, design, and implementation
                        of the front end. After this, I joined EAGLE6. I have
                        been with EAGLE6 for nearly 5 years, starting in June of
                        2015 as a UX researcher focusing on usability,
                        information design & architecture, and user modeling.
